# Abstract

Start an online session [Here](https://xumarcus.github.io/othello). Look up the game rules [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Othello). AI employs basic [MCTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Exploration_and_exploitation). Each turn takes around **3** seconds. Written in [Typescript 4](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React 17](https://reactjs.org/versions/) with [FP-TS](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) because Javascript sucks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
